<H1>Exercise: Using a Hidden Markov Model</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<strong>Description:</strong>
In this exercise, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a model of word
generation from part-of-speech sequences. We will: 

<UL>
<LI>Train an HMM on a sample of English-like text 
<LI>Inspect the resulting model 
<LI>Generate sentences at random from the model 
<LI>Create test sentences and find the most likely hidden state sequence
</UL>

<P> <strong>Credits:</strong> The <A
HREF="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kanungo/software/software.html"> HMM
package</A> we are using in this exercise was written by <A
HREF="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kanungo/">Tapas Kanungo</A>, and this
exercise, the accompanying scripts, etc. were written by by <A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/">Philip Resnik</A>.  Note that
the version of the HMM package included with this exercise (see
"Getting the Code", below) includes <strong>only</strong> Solaris
executables, not <A
HREF="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~kanungo/software/software.html">the
complete HMM source code.</A>
<P>

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This exercise assumes basic
familiarity with typical Unix commands, and the ability to create text
files (e.g. using a text editor such as <em>vi</em> or
<em>emacs</em>). No programming is required.  <P>

<strong>Notational Convention:</strong> The symbols &lt;== will be used to
identify a comment from the instructor, on lines where you're typing
something in. So, for example, in

  <PRE>    
    %  cp file1.txt file2.txt   <== The "cp" is short for "copy"
  </PRE>

<P>what you're supposed to type at the prompt (identified by the percent
sign, here) is 

  <PRE>
    cp file1.txt file2.txt
  </PRE>
followed by a carriage return.

<H2>Getting Logged In and Getting the Code</H2>

<OL>
<LI> For this lab, you will use a Solaris machine.
<PRE>
  % mkdir hmm                 <== Create a subdirectory called "hmm"
  % cd hmm                    <== Go into that directory
  % ftp umiacs.umd.edu        <== Invoke the "ftp" program

  Name (yourname): anonymous  <==   Type "anonymous" (without quotes)
  Password: name@address      <==   Type your e-mail address

  ftp> cd pub/resnik/723      <==   Go to directory pub/resnik/723
  ftp> binary                 <==   Tell ftp to use binary transfer mode
  ftp> get hmm.tar            <==   Download the file containing the code
  ftp> bye                    <==   Exit from ftp

  % tar xvf hmm.tar           <== Extract code from the file
  % rm hmm.tar                <== Delete the file (to conserve space)

  % chmod u+x *.pl            <== Make perl programs executable
</PRE>
If you cannot run the Perl scripts (the files that have a .pl suffix), you probably have Perl installed at a different path than we do. You can fix this by using pickperl script. First find out the path for Perl that you are using, and then run pickperl as follows:

<pre>
  % pickperl /usr/imports/bin/perl /your/perl/path/perl  <== get correct perl
</pre>
<P>

<LI>Now go into directory example0: 

  <PRE>    
    %  cd example0
  </PRE>

<LI>Run <STRONG>link</STRONG> to make the HMM programs available for
    running in this directory:

  <PRE>
    %  link 
  </PRE>

</OL>
<P>
<HR>

<H2>Creating the Training Data</H2>

<OL>

<LI>Look at file example0.train, which contains a very small corpus generated
using a very simple English-like grammar. 

  <PRE>    
    %  more example0.train 
  </PRE>

Alternatively, open the file in an editor.  What parts of speech would
you say are represented in this file? Write down a list of parts of
speech and the words you think belong to each one.  Notice that the
same word can appear in multiple parts of speech. Include your answer
in your report.
<P>


<LI>Turn example0.train into training input for the HMM code, by
running the <STRONG>create_key.pl</STRONG> program. This reads in the
training file and converts each unique word into a unique number,
since the HMM program uses numbers rather than symbols. For example,
"the tall man saw the short man" might be translated into the sequence
"1 2 3 4 1 5 3".

  <PRE>
    %  create_key.pl example0.key < example0.train > example0.seq
  </PRE>

Feel free to look at file example0.key, which now contains the mapping
from words to their corresponding numbers, and at file example0.seq,
which now contains the training input represented as numbers rather
than words.  The "T=" value at the top of example0.seq tells you how
many symbols there are in the training sequence.  (In this case the
number should be 590.)
</OL>
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Training the HMM</H2>

<OL>
<LI> To train the model we will use the <strong>esthmm</strong> program.
This program needs to know the number of symbols in the alphabet of
the HMM (that is, symbols that can be emitted); you can obtain this by
typing 
  <PRE>
    %  wc -l example0.key
  </PRE>
In this case the number of symbols is 13.  The number of states is
something you can choose.  Recall that for a HMM-based part-of-speech
model like this one, each state corresponds to a part of speech
(i.e. a syntactic category like noun, verb, etc.), so the number of
states to choose corresponds to the number of parts of speech you
believe are represented in the corpus.  In this case, let's use 6
states.  We run the <strong>esthmm</strong> program as follows:
  <PRE>
    %  esthmm 6 13 example0.seq > example0.hmm
  </PRE>
This creates file example0.hmm, which contains the trained model.
Depending on the computer you're running this on, this might take 
a minute.
<P>

<LI> If you'd like, look at file example0.hmm -- it's not the easiest
thing in the world to read, but you can see how the model is
represented there.  At the top are specified the number of states and
the number of symbols (M=13 symbols, N=6 states).  Then you have the
complete A matrix, i.e. the 6-by-6 transition probability matrix.
Next you have the 6-by-13 emission probability matrix, B.  Finally you
have the pi vector, giving initial probabilities for the 6 states.
<P>
</OL>

<HR>
<H2>Inspecting the Model</H2>

<OL>
<LI> To view the model you've just created a bit more readably,
keeping only the most useful information, run the
<strong>viewhmm.pl</strong> program.  This shows the state-to-state
transition probabilities when they are above a certain threshold
probability, since very low transition probabilities probably don't
tell you much about the structure of the model.  Similarly, for the
emission probabilities, it shows only the symbols emitted with a
sufficiently high probability.  (And it shows them as words, not
numbers, for easier readability.)  Run <strong>viewhmm.pl</strong> as
follows:
  <PRE>
    %  viewhmm.pl example0.hmm example0.key 0.01 0.01 
  </PRE>
Chances are it scrolls by too fast, you you may want to do this
instead:
  <PRE>
    %  viewhmm.pl example0.hmm example0.key 0.01 0.01 | more
  </PRE>
Or, you might want to save the output to a file:
  <PRE>
    %  viewhmm.pl example0.hmm example0.key 0.01 0.01 > example0.view
  </PRE>
<P>

<LI> Based on what you see when you run <strong>viewhmm.pl</strong>,
draw, on paper, a transition diagram for this HMM.  That is, write
each state as a node labeled by the state number, and write
probabilities on the arcs from state to state. Include the transition
diagram in your report.
<P>

<LI> Now, based on what you see when you run
<strong>viewhmm.pl</strong>, label each state in your transition
diagram with a part of speech.  How good a match is there between your
intuitions, earlier, and the way the model has automatically decided
which are the high-probability symbols for each state?  If there are
mismatches, are they linguistically interesting? Include all your answers
in your report.
<P>
</OL>

<HR>
<H2>Generating Sentences at Random from the Model</H2>

<OL>
<LI>  Using your transition diagram and the output of
<strong>viewhmm.pl</strong>, start at the the most likely start state,
and write down the most likely symbol to be emitted there.  (Break
ties at random.)  Then follow the most likely arc to the next state,
and write down the most likely symbol to be emitted <em>there</em>.
Continue in this fashion until you emit a punctuation mark, or until
you get bored. Include the sentence you generate in your report.
<P>

<LI> Now we'll have the computer do this same process.  Since it
doesn't ever get bored, we'll have to tell it how many symbols to emit
before it stops -- say, 100.  To do this, run the
<strong>genseq</strong> program:
  <PRE>
    %  genseq example0.hmm 100
  </PRE>
Notice that the output isn't very readable, since the program
generates symbols as numbers.  We can take that output, though, and
run it through the <strong>ints2words.pl</strong> program to replace
the numbers with the corresponding words:
  <PRE>
    %  genseq example0.hmm 100 | ints2words.pl example0.key
  </PRE>
<P>
</OL>


<HR>
<H2>Finding the Hidden State Sequence for a Test Sentence</H2>

<OL>

<LI> Let's create a sentence to use as input to the model.  First,
create a file <strong>example0.test.words</strong> containing the word
sequence that you got when you ran through the model state by state by
hand, above.  You can do this using an editor, or you can do it by
typing
  <PRE>
    %  cat > example0.test.words
  </PRE>
then typing the sentence in, hitting return, and then typing
control-D. Don't forget to make sure everything is lowercase, and make
sure the punctuation mark is a separate word, not attached to the last
word of the sentence.
<P>

<LI> Turn the file you've just created into the right format for the 
HMM programs, by running <strong>words2seq.pl</strong> program as follows:
  <PRE>
    %  words2seq.pl example0.key < example0.test.words > example0.test
  </PRE>
If you're interested, take a look at file example0.test to see
what the input sequence looks like.
<P>

<LI> Find the sequence of hidden states most likely to have generated
the symbol sequence in example0.test, by using the
<strong>testvit</strong> program:
  <PRE>
    %  testvit example0.hmm example0.test
  </PRE>
The program reports the probability of the symbol sequence, given the
most likely sequence of states, and it also reports the optimal state
sequence.
<P>

<LI> Take that optimal state sequence, and replace each state number
with the part-of-speech label you assigned to that state.  
<P>

<LI> Congratulations!  You've just done some HMM-based part-of-speech
tagging.  Does the sequence of parts of speech correspond to what you
expected? Include your answer, the sentence, the optimal state
sequence, and corresponding part of speech tag sequence in your
report.
<P>
</OL>

<HR>
<H2>Time for Fun</H2>

Now that you've gone through this exercise, here are some suggestions
for further exploration:
<OL>
<LI>  Try getting the state sequence (part-of-speech tags) for some
more sentences -- you can look at example0.key to see what words
you're allowed to use.  To speed things up, you can skip the step of
creating example0.test.words by executing:
<PRE>
  %  cat | words2seq.pl example0.key > example0.testA
</PRE>
Typing your sentence in, hitting return, and then typing control-D to
end and create file example0.testA.  (You can use suffixes testA,
testB, etc. for new sentences.)  As before, don't forget to make sure
everything is lowercase, and make sure punctuation are separated from
other words by spaces.  Once you've created example0.testA, run the
<strong>testvit</strong> program on that file, as described above.
<P>

<LI> Go back to "Training the HMM", but this time increase the number
of states to 7 or 8 or 9.  Go through the rest of the exercise of
labeling the resulting states with part-of-speech tags.  Include your
answers to following questions in your report: What does the model do
when it has more states to play with, for this training set?  What do
you think are some possible consequences of having more states, in
terms of the model's ability to tag accurately, and in terms of the
linguistic facts the model captures?
<P>

<LI> Go back to "Training the HMM", but this time decrease the number
of states to, say, 3 or 4.  Same questions as in the previous
paragraph: what are the consequences? Include your answers in your report.<P>

<LI> Let's look at some more interesting data, using a more
interesting English-like language.  Go into the
<strong>example1</strong> directory:
  <PRE>
  %  cd ../example1
  </PRE>
Now do the following:
<P>
  <OL>
    <LI> Run the <strong>link</strong> program as described earlier.  This
    time, though, you <em>won't</em> do the "Creating the Training Data"
    or "Training the HMM" steps, because the training would take too long.
    (Could be a few hours, depending on the machine.)  Instead, go
    straight to "Inspecting the Model".  Notice that this is a bigger HMM
    with a richer language:  there are 36 symbols in the vocabulary, and
    the HMM has 12 states.
    <P>
    <LI> Do some of the same steps as we did for example0, particularly
    assigning a part-of-speech label by hand to each state, and generating 
    some text at random using the <strong>genseq.pl</strong> program.
    <P>
    <LI> Look at the file example1.train, and see if you can come up
    with a context-free grammar that generates this language, or 
    something close to it.  (If you want to cheat, look at file
    gen.lisp in your hmm directory.)
    <P>
    <LI> Looking at the random text you generated using the 
    <strong>genseq.pl</strong> program, do you see some sentences
    that could not have been generated by the context-free grammar?
    Why do those sentences get generated by the HMM but not the CFG?
    Include your answer in your report.
    <P>
